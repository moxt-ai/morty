# Engineering Rules

These rules apply to the entire repository. You must read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening an issue or pull request; it defines contribution and implementation requirements. See [TESTING.md](./docs/TESTING.md) for delivery and testing guidance. Every code review must also follow [CODE_REVIEW.md](./docs/CODE_REVIEW.md).

## Repository setup

- Before beginning any repository work, run `pnpm sync:submodules` so every submodule is initialized and updated from its configured tracking branch.

## Trust Boundary

The local execution boundary is the only authority allowed to approve local side effects.

- Treat every value received from a remote client, transport, agent harness, model, configuration file, or persisted session as untrusted input.
- Process untrusted input in this order: decode as `unknown`, validate its schema, normalize and resolve security-sensitive targets, authorize the requested capability and resolved target, execute, then record an audit event.
- Validate both the requested representation and the resolved representation of paths, URLs, commands, and other security-sensitive targets.
- Never let a remote assertion, prior validation result, or user-interface approval bypass authorization at the execution boundary.

## Deployment topology

- Staging Chat (`morty.paradev.biz`) is configured to call the production Platform relay (`mobius.moxt.ai`). For cross-service staging incidents, inspect `mobius-platform-production`, not the staging Platform Worker.

## State Modeling

Make illegal states unrepresentable.

- Represent protocol and lifecycle states with discriminated unions, not combinations of optional fields or booleans.
- Give each variant exactly the data that is valid in that state, using `readonly` properties for state values.
- Handle state variants exhaustively so a new variant causes a compile-time failure at every incomplete decision point.
- Express state changes through explicit transition functions. Do not mutate fields into a different state.
- Do not use type assertions, `Partial`, or non-null assertions to bypass state invariants.

## Contracts

- Use `readonly` properties for protocol messages, domain values, and port interfaces.
- Declare callbacks and port operations as function properties, such as `readonly send: (message: Message) => Promise<void>`, so `strictFunctionTypes` checks their parameter variance.

## Compatibility is mandatory by default

Morty Web, SDK clients, deployed services, local Mobius Runtimes, and stored data
upgrade independently. Preserve existing external contracts and behavior in both
directions: new clients with old servers/Runtimes, and old clients with new
servers/Runtimes. A successful all-new deployment does not establish compatibility.

- Only an explicit instruction from the human user or maintainer to make a
  particular breaking change authorizes incompatibility. A request to refactor,
  simplify, upgrade, bump a major version, or remove apparently unused code does
  not authorize it. AI agents must not invent an end-of-support decision.
- When a breaking change is explicitly required, limit it to the authorized
  contract and record the instruction, affected peers/data, rollout, and recovery
  consequences in the PR. Preserve every unaffected contract. Do not request the
  same authorization again when it is already explicit.
- Preserve accepted request formats, response meanings, defaults, error codes,
  and retry/idempotency guarantees. New fields, enum values, or message kinds are
  not automatically compatible: check the actual released readers and callers.
  Silently ignoring an unknown operation is not successful execution.
- Enable a new operation or representation only after establishing support for
  that contract at the relevant protocol boundary. Define the behavior of peers
  that omit the new capability; they must retain the existing supported behavior.
  Agent/ACP capabilities do not establish Runtime/relay protocol support.
- Deploy compatible receivers before enabling new senders. Keep the old path
  usable during independent upgrades and supported rollback. Do not require a
  browser refresh, Runtime upgrade, or synchronized deployment to preserve an
  existing supported operation.
- Keep compatibility decisions in the owning protocol adapter, not scattered
  across views or callers. Prefer negotiated protocol support to application
  release-number special cases. Reuse authoritative connection information;
  do not add duplicate persistent capability state.
- Do not switch protocol representations or generate a new operation identity
  after an ambiguous failure to guess whether a peer supports an operation.
  Preserve the request's meaning, identity, and existing recovery guarantees.
- For a changed contract, provide focused integration/contract evidence for both
  mixed-version directions using released peers or independently retained old
  contracts. Do not replace the old baseline with the new implementation or
  weaken validation, authorization, or size limits to make compatibility pass.
  Follow [CODE_REVIEW.md](./docs/CODE_REVIEW.md) before declaring the change ready.

## Async Operations

- Every asynchronous operation that waits on an external system must accept cancellation. Finite operations need a timeout; long-lived streams need connection and liveness deadlines.
- Propagate cancellation through every layer. Do not catch, translate, or retry cancellation as an ordinary failure.
- Make resource ownership explicit. The code that acquires a connection, stream, process, lock, timer, or concurrency slot must release it on success, failure, and cancellation.
- Keep retries bounded, cancellable, and limited to operations that are safe to repeat.

## Errors

- Failures that cross a subsystem, port, or protocol boundary must use a typed error contract with a stable machine-readable code.
- Branch on error codes or types, never on human-readable message text.
- Preserve the original cause when translating an error, and expose only sanitized messages across trust boundaries.
- Keep cancellation, timeout, retryable, and terminal failures distinct.

## Documentation changes

- Every Markdown file except `SKILL.md` must include `metadata.change-policy` in its
  YAML frontmatter, stating that changes require a separate documentation-only PR
  for review and approval. Skill entrypoints retain their existing frontmatter.
- Change Markdown files in documentation-only pull requests, separate from code,
  configuration, dependencies, and submodule updates. This includes additions,
  deletions, and renames of `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.mdx` files.
- Review by `taowen-paraflow` is recommended for Markdown changes, not required.
- Documentation defines product intent, constraints, and operational guidance.
  Do not maintain implementation maps, source-file inventories, or copies of
  protocol fields and state machines in Markdown. Make source organization,
  names, types, and focused inline comments explain the implementation.
- When changing an existing documented constraint, propose that change separately
  before implementing behavior that depends on it.

## Delivery

- Deliver behavior as the smallest user-runnable vertical slice through input, logic, and observable output.
- Describe each behavior slice as: "After this, a user can ... and see ..." If that sentence is not concrete, narrow the slice.
- Start every behavior change with a failing Given-When-Then acceptance scenario that proves the user-visible slice through the first supported product boundary that can observe it. Treat the scenario as executable product documentation, and implement only what it requires.
- Do not add unit tests by default. Add one only when the user explicitly requests unit-level coverage or a repository maintainer documents an exception for an invariant that cannot be exercised through a supported product boundary.
- Only write end-to-end tests for happy paths. Business logic must be covered by integration tests, while protocols and external boundaries use integration or contract tests. Do not test CI, linting, Git hooks, build tooling, dependency configuration, or other repository scaffolding.
- Web application integration tests exercise user behavior through visible controls and must not access stores directly. They bootstrap and render the complete application rather than isolated components or views. Prefer accessible roles, names, labels, and visible text; use shared `data-testid.ts` constants when no stable semantic selector exists. Worker integration tests enter through their production HTTP, WebSocket, Durable Object, queue, or storage boundary.
- Test boundaries follow `docs/TESTING.md`: Morty Web, Worker, and browser tests keep product services, transports, and the production daemon real. They inject a stateful controlled ACP harness only through the daemon's Agent dependency argument. Separate agent-daemon compatibility tests use the real daemon, each real Agent executable, and its production adapter; a fake LLM provider can replace the model service. A controlled ACP harness exercises production daemon behavior but cannot establish Agent compatibility.
- Except for deterministic fake timers, mocks, spies, stubs, monkey patching, module replacement, and canned request interceptors are prohibited. If a real external dependency cannot be used safely or deterministically, inject a stateful fake through its production port.
- Tests involving time must use fake timers with an explicit system time. Every test is prohibited from using real sleeps, wall-clock time, polling delays, or timing tolerances.
- Assert externally observable results, not private control flow, collaborator calls, or implementation details.
- Documentation-only and mechanical refactoring changes do not require new tests when behavior is unchanged.

## Abstraction

### Server layers

Server behavior flows inward through `http/do -> service -> storage -> database`. HTTP routes and Durable Objects translate and orchestrate requests, services own domain validation and transformations, storage owns persistence through the authoritative Drizzle schema and ORM query builder, and gateways communicate our services with external services. Do not skip layers or move domain/protocol decisions into storage. Do not issue raw SQL strings where the ORM can express the query.

- Prefer direct, local, linear code.
- Add an abstraction only for a real external boundary, a second real use case, or proven duplication.
- Do not add speculative extension points, generic frameworks, or unused layers.

## Database schema

- Do not define foreign-key constraints. Enforce relationships and deletion behavior explicitly in application logic.
- Keep the authoritative Drizzle schema for each SQLite target under `src/schema/<target>` (for example, `schema/d1` or `schema/project-do`). Never place Durable Object tables in `schema/d1`, and never use one target's schema as the implicit schema for another target.
- Keep Drizzle configuration in the repository-level `drizzle/` directory and generate each target's migrations into `migrations/<target>`.
- Generate schema migrations with the repository's pinned Drizzle CLI. Never create or edit migration SQL manually.
- Durable Object runtime code must execute committed `.sql` migrations generated for its target; do not embed application-table DDL or migration SQL in TypeScript. Prefer importing the SQL directly with `?raw`. Where the build pipeline cannot import SQL, use a committed code-generation script that copies the generated SQL verbatim into a gitignored module and keep `.sql` as the source of truth.
- Treat committed migration files as immutable history; make subsequent schema changes with a new generated migration.

## Verification

For routine local development, run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and only the
related test cases. Use `pnpm ci:check` locally only when diagnosing the combined
CI validation.
