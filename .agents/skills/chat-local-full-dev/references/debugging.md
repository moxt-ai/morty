# Debugging the local stack

Work from evidence to root cause. The local stack is a real Worker with real
Durable Objects, so most deployed failure modes reproduce locally.

## Where the evidence is

| Evidence | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Morty Worker output | `chatLog` from `prepare` |
| Runtime manager diagnostics | `setupLog` from the stack `runtimes` record (`logs --worker runtime`) and the manager's `daemon.log` at a versioned installation path under `<stateDir>/morty` (`find <stateDir>/morty -name daemon.log`) |
| D1 / Durable Objects / R2 | `chatPersist` |
| Stack record (pids, origins, paths) | `<stateDir>/stack.json` |

Read logs with `node scripts/local-dev.cjs logs --state-dir <stateDir> ...` rather
than opening files directly, so filtering and following stay consistent.

## Correlating one request

1. Capture the failing browser operation, request method, path, status and time.
   Keep credentials and request bodies containing private content out of reports.
2. Inspect the matching Worker and Runtime logs for that time window. Follow the
   computer and request identifiers when present; do not assume an event name from
   an older release still exists.
3. Read the structured error code and sanitized cause chain. Correlate the cloud
   failure with the local daemon evidence before assigning a root cause.

Branch on typed error codes, never human-readable message text. A successful HTTP
response alone does not establish that the requested Agent operation completed.

## Inspecting persisted state

Directory D1 tables live under `<chatPersist>/v3/d1/<hash>/`. Durable Object SQLite
lives under `<chatPersist>/v3/do/<class-name>/<id>.sqlite`. Inspect either with
the `sqlite3` CLI:

```sh
sqlite3 <path.sqlite> '.tables'
```

The current conversation directory is owned by the connected Runtime. Retained
cloud tables from earlier releases are not evidence of current managed Sessions.

Durable Object and D1 files are WAL-backed. Inspect them through SQLite so the WAL
is included. To stop the stack before inspection while retaining its evidence,
use `node scripts/local-dev.cjs remove --state-dir <stateDir> --keep-state`;
`remove` without `--keep-state` deletes the isolated state directory.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Runtime reconnect loop, close code 1008 `Invalid protocol message` | The running Runtime and local relay use different release contracts | Rebuild the checkout CLI and start a fresh isolated stack through `scripts/local-dev`; check `morty status` |
| Relay exits after `Can't call WebSocket send() after close()` | A replaced or closing daemon socket received a send | Correlate `chatLog` and Runtime diagnostics; fix the relay boundary |
| Validation failure (400) | The request does not match the current schema | Read the typed error and validation issue path |
| A missing Session or conversation | Wrong computer or local state directory | Compare the requested identity with the stack record |
| A stopped stack's port remains bound | Another stack still owns the port | Use `status` and remove only the identified stack |
| Unresolved workspace packages or duplicated ACP SDK instances | Locked dependencies were not installed consistently | Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` at the workspace root and rebuild the CLI |

## Boundary checklist

When a request fails validation, compare every boundary in order:

1. Browser request construction and serialized body size.
2. Morty Worker global body limit, route body limit, and schema.
3. ComputerRelay authorization and local relay operations.
4. Runtime or Agent protocol validation.

## Reproduce with a narrow API call

For a contract-level reproduction, call the supported Chat HTTP boundary at
`chatOrigin`. Establish an isolated identity through the setup helper first;
creation is idempotent and requires a creation key. Reuse the fixture's authorized
identity for the relevant computer, and keep credentials out of transcripts and
logs. Do not bypass admission or authorization just to reach a handler.

## Escalating to deployed environments

If the failure only appears in a deployed environment, stop and use the
`worker-debug` skill. Never point a local stack at a Cloudflare account, and never
run `wrangler tail` or `wrangler deploy` from this skill.
