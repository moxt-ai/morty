 *
 * iOS keeps reporting the full safe-area inset while the keyboard covers the home indicator, so a safe-area margin
 * or padding at the bottom edge would float the container above the keyboard. Neither a coarse pointer nor focus
 * proves the keyboard is visible, because a Bluetooth keyboard has both, so this compares the visible height with
 * the tallest height seen before. A host that never shrinks its viewport leaves the marker off and the safe-area
 * spacing in place. The marker is a DOM attribute, so the layout flips without re-rendering. Listeners are bound and
 * released with the container element.
