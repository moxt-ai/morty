# Development

## Product boundary

Anonymous credentials and Clerk sessions resolve to a canonical internal user ID.
Clerk verifies a user session only. The application does not read Clerk Organization
claims. Platform Project setup uses the server-held AppCredential; the Worker
supplies a logical location hint and Platform resolves its storage placement. Bots and
Chat support anonymous users; Slack additionally requires a verified Clerk session.

Users open Chat directly on `/` and automatically receive a personal Bot.
The active web flow has no Project setup or Slack navigation. The web application
sends its anonymous credential or Clerk bearer token to Chat for ownership checks
and conversation access. Platform independently authorizes SDK operations.

## Worker structure

Feature logic stays below `packages/worker/src/components`:

- `cloud`: Clerk configuration, token verification, and `/mobius-cloud/api`.
- `chat`: safe forwarding for `/mobius/api/*`.
- `slack`: Slack HTTP routes, services, queue processing, D1/R2 adapters, and rate limiting.

All external gateways and top-level request dispatch stay directly under
`packages/worker/src/gateway`; components do not contain gateway directories.

Slack is source code in the Worker package, not an embedded package or standalone
deployment. Shared runtime helpers remain directly under `packages/worker/src/infra`.

## Storage

Every environment binds one D1 database as `DATABASE` and one R2 bucket as
`ATTACHMENTS`. The Cloud-owned schema is `packages/worker/migrations/0001_initial.sql`.
Apply it locally with:

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler d1 migrations apply DATABASE --local
```

Staging and production resources are named in `wrangler.jsonc`. Apply remote
migrations with the matching Wrangler environment.

## External Mobius

`MOBIUS_BASE_URL` must be an HTTP loopback origin for local development or an HTTPS
origin elsewhere. It cannot contain credentials, a path, query, fragment, or Cloud's
own origin. `MOBIUS_APP_ID` and `MOBIUS_APP_SECRET` authenticate Worker operations.
The active Chat API issues short-lived conversation credentials after checking Bot
ownership. The browser uses `createMobiusConversationSession` to communicate directly
with Mobius, including history, messages, events, and credential refresh.
Slack's `MobiusGateway` also calls Mobius
directly and rejects recursive configuration and redirects.

## Verification

Run `pnpm check`. Product behavior is covered at HTTP and browser boundaries; tests
use deterministic time and stateful fakes rather than request mocks.
